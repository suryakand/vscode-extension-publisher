## Setup Requirements

### 1. VS Code Marketplace Personal Access Token

1. Go to [Visual Studio Marketplace Publisher Management](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage)
2. Create a Personal Access Token with **Marketplace** scope
3. Add it as a repository secret named `VSCE_PAT`

### 3. Required Dependencies

Your extension should have `@vscode/vsce` as a dev dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @vscode/vsce
```

### 2. GitHub Token Permissions

Ensure your workflow has the necessary permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: read
```

## Quick Start

## Package Manager Support

The action supports multiple package managers:

- **npm** (default)
- **yarn**
- **pnpm**

## Required Scripts

Your `package.json` should include these scripts (or configure custom ones):

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "vscode:prepublish": "npm run compile",
    "compile": "tsc -p ./",
    "lint": "eslint src --ext ts",
    "test": "node out/test/runTest.js",
    "verify": "npx @vscode/vsce login",
    "package": "npx @vscode/vsce package",
    "publish": "npx @vscode/vsce publish"
  }
}
```

### Basic Usage

```yaml
name: Publish VS Code Extension

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Publish Extension

          version-bump-type: ${{ github.event.inputs.version-type }}
```

### Multi-Environment Setup

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Test Extension
        uses: your-org/vscode-extension-publisher@v1
        with:
          vsce-pat: ${{ secrets.VSCE_PAT }}
          skip-tests: 'false'
          create-github-release: 'false'
          upload-vsix-artifact: 'true'

  publish:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      
      - name: Publish Extension
        uses: your-org/vscode-extension-publisher@v1
        with:
          vsce-pat: ${{ secrets.VSCE_PAT }}
          skip-tests: 'true'  # Already tested in previous job
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Error**: Ensure your `VSCE_PAT` secret is correctly set
2. **Permission Denied**: Check GitHub token permissions for writing to repository
3. **Package Not Found**: Verify your package.json scripts exist
4. **Version Conflict**: Ensure the version in package.json doesn't already exist

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting the `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` secret to `true` in your repository.
